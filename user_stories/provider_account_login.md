## Priority

**Range**: 10<br>
**Iteration**: 1

**Notes:** <br>

- This is a foundational feature for providers to access the system.
- Without login functionality, providers cannot access any other services.
- Easy to implement using standard authentication libraries.

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**

- Provider registration is already implemented.
- Standard registration interface - username (or email and phone number), password
- Connect to the backend API.

**Planning Poker:**
- DANG CHEN: 1 day (Iteration 1)
- Denzel Suhermin: 2 days (Iteration X)  
- Rui Yan: 1 days (Iteration x)  
- Jin Wang: 2 days (Iteration 1)
- **Average:** `1.5` days 

--------------------------

## Tasks

3. Integrate with backend login API - Estimation `2` days<br>
4. Test - Estimation `0.5` days<br>
