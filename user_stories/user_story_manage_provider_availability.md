# User Story: Manage Provider Availability

## Description
**Description-v1:** As a service provider on MyClean, I want to manage my availability schedule so that customers can book my cleaning services at times that work for me.

## Priority
**Range:** 10 (Highest significance)  
**Iteration:** 2  
**Notes:**  
- This is a core feature for service providers to ensure they can control their schedules.  
- Essential for enabling customer bookings, which is a foundational aspect of the app.  
- High priority because it directly impacts the app’s ability to function for providers.

## Estimation
**Assumptions:**  
- Standard availability fields (days, time slots, status).  
- Backend API required to store and retrieve provider availability.  
- Input validation for time slots to avoid overlaps.  
- Secure storage of provider data.  

**Planning Poker Results:**  
- DANG CHEN: 2 days  
- DENZEL SUHERMIN: 1.5 days   
- RUI YAN: 1 day 
- JIN WANG: 1.5 days 
- **Average:** 1.5 days

## Tasks
**Backend (DANG CHEN & RUI YAN):**  
1. Design provider availability API and data model – 0.5 days  
2. Implement availability endpoint with validation – 1 day  
3. Implement time slot conflict detection – 0.5 days  
4. Create database storage for availability – 0.5 days  
5. Write tests – 1 day  

**Frontend (DENZEL SUHERMIN & JIN WANG):**  
1. Design availability schedule UI – 0.5 days  
2. Implement schedule form with validation – 1 day  
3. Connect to backend API – 0.5 days  
4. Handle responses and navigation – 0.5 days  
5. Write tests – 0.5 days  

## UI Design (PICS)
**Availability Schedule Elements:**  
- “MyClean” logo  
- “MANAGE YOUR AVAILABILITY” heading  
- Input fields: Day of Week, Time Slots (Start Time, End Time), Status (Available/Unavailable)  
- “SAVE SCHEDULE” button  
- “BACK TO DASHBOARD” link  
- Error message display area  

## Completion Criteria
- Providers can successfully set and update their availability with valid time slots.  
- Form validates input and shows appropriate error messages.  
- Successful updates redirect to the provider dashboard.  
- Availability data is securely stored.
