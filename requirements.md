## 2. Priority Justification
- **Priority 10:** Core features that directly enable booking, account access, and service availability. These are essential for the MVP release.  
- **Priority 30:** Important features, but not blocking for the initial MVP. Can be delivered after all critical functions are operational.  

- The priority is based on the **MoSCoW** method:
  - **Must Have**（10分）→ Functions that must be delivered in the first stage
  - **Should Have**（20-30分） →    The second phase of delivery can be postponed
